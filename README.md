# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. Follow these steps to run the code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project contains health-related data, including information about individuals' age, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, and other relevant features, as well as whether or not they have been diagnosed with diabetes. Here is a brief overview of the dataset's key attributes:

- __Age:__ The age of the individual.
- __BMI:__ Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- __Blood Pressure:__ The individual's blood pressure.
- __Glucose Level:__ The individual's glucose (blood sugar) level.
- __Diabetes Diagnosis:__ A binary value indicating whether the individual has diabetes (1 for yes, 0 for no).

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Anaconda installed on your computer.
2. Create a Python environment with necessary packages. You can do this using Anaconda or a virtual environment. You will need packages such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Getting Started

1. Open Anaconda Navigator.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator.
3. In the Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the directory where you want to save this project.
4. In your web browser, go to the GitHub repository where the project files are hosted: [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/Roshanat19/AI_DIABETES-PREDICTION-.git).
5. Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to download the entire project as a ZIP file.
6. Extract the ZIP file to your chosen directory.
7. Inside the extracted folder, you will find the Jupyter Notebook file named `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`. Open this file by clicking on it.

## Running the Code

1. Once the Jupyter Notebook is open, you will find all the project code and documentation.
2. In the Jupyter Notebook, run each cell one by one. Make sure to execute them in sequential order.
3. The code will start by loading the dataset, performing data preprocessing, and building a machine learning model for diabetes prediction.
4. Review the project documentation within the Jupyter Notebook for insights, results, and model performance.

## Dependencies

Ensure that you have the following Python packages installed within your Anaconda environment:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using the Anaconda Navigator environment or by running the following commands in a Jupyter Notebook cell:

```python
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

This README file includes instructions for downloading the Jupyter Notebook from a GitHub repository, loading the dataset, running the code in a Jupyter Notebook environment, and understanding the project's results and insights. Enjoy exploring the world of diabetes prediction!
